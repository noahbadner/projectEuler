# Maximum path sum I
# Problem 18
#
# By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from
# top to bottom is 23.
#   >3<
#  >7<4
#  2>4<6
# 8 5>9<3
# [included in resource file]
#
# That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.
#
# Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:
# [included in resource file]
#
# NOTE: As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route. However, Problem 67,
# is the same challenge with a triangle containing one-hundred rows; it cannot be solved by brute force, and requires a
# clever method! ;o)
# Solution: 1074; Runtime: O(Nlog(N))
